# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
```
Utilizing a weather API allows the user to search for different forecase in whatever city they seach. Data such as temeprature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index are shown as well as a five day forecase. Logging their past city searchs is helpful to prevent double searches and take them back to that city selection.
